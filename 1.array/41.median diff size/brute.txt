It can, however, be explained like this:
median (odd set of numbers) = ((n+1)/2)th term
median (even set of numbers) = ((n/2)th term + ((n/2)+1)th term)/2
how to find median


m size of arr1 and n of arr2
create another array of m+n
sort it
find m+n/2 based on odd and even
time->m+n)log(m+n)
space-m+n
